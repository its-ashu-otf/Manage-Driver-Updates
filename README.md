## 🧠 Why Use This?

Windows Update often installs generic or unstable drivers—especially for GPU and chipset components. This can result in:

* Screen flickering
* Audio dropouts
* System crashes after update
* Resetting custom driver settings

This tool gives you **granular control** over that behavior—without Group Policy Editor or third-party tools.

## 🔐 Safety & Compatibility

* No third-party dependencies
* Can be safely reverted with the **"Enable"** option
* Does not interfere with normal Windows security updates
